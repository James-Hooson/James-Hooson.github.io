        Paddings, Borders and Margins are used for a variety of reasons in web
        design. Some call them the foundations of a site, used to make a site
        visually appealing and pleasant to navigate. It can easily be overlooked
        by a user as it looks so simple yet it is so effective at presenting
        content in a user friendly form.

        1. PADDING - This is the space INSIDE the element. This space dictates
        how much room there is between text and the border of your element.
        Imagine writing on a piece of paper but starting right at the edge of
        the paper. This makes its feel cramped on the page, but if we leave a
        space between the edge of the paper, and where we start writing, that
        space is called padding.

      />

      <p class="simplebox">
        2. BORDER - The outline/edge of the element. What this does is it
        creates a visible line around the element. The border can help identify
        or differentiate pieces of information easily, or used to attract focus
        to a specifiy point. Now imagine that piece of paper we spoke of before
        with all of our fancy imgainary writing. The edges of that paper is what
        we would call a border

      />

      <p class="simplebox">
        3. MARGIN - This is the space OUTSIDE the element. What this does is
        creates space between this element and other elements. Think of it as
        "personal space" around the element. This can be useful for align items
        within the page and giving gaps around the edges. Back to our imaginary
        paper, its looks so nice with its fancy writing, nice spaces between the
        writing and the edge of the paper (our padding), and the edge of the
        paper (our border), and it looks so nice! So why don't we frame it in a
        picture frame. The picture frame is what we would call the margin.
