      <h1>Neuroplasticity</h1>

      <p class="simplebox">
        Neuroplasticity is the science behind our brains, and more so how we
        think and learn. Understanding neuroplasticity can be incredibly helpful
        for anyone in life. Neuroplasticity is the understanding that our brains
        are ever changing and ever learning. That we don’t necessarily have a
        “cap” on our intelligence or ways of thinking. Our brains have pathways,
        and every time we use a pathway, it strengthens. Everytime we try
        thinking outside of our comfort zone, exploring other avenues for
        answers or results we are wanting can create and help improve other
        neural pathways.

      <h1>Growth Mindset</h1>
      <p class="simplebox">
        When you hear someone say “well that's just how I am”, that just simply
        isn't true, They may not have tried to think or explore other avenues
        and in turn are likely restricted themselves. This could be called a
        “fixed” mindset. Exploring Neuroplasticity within ourselves is
        considered a “growth mindset”. It's about changing the way we think and
        approach problems in our lives, whether that be academic or daily life.
        A “growth mindset” can be very helpful to our perspective of ourselves
        and the perspective of how much we can achieve. Instead of thinking
        about passing or failing a new idea or concept, we could change how we
        think about it, such as “I don’t quite understand YET”. This alone
        changes our perception of our task, instead of giving it a rigid
        structure of success or failure, we change it to a fluid structure that
        has no real end but more of a process that allows failure while also
        encouraging more meaningful connections to what is being learned. These
        connections are what allow us to look at problems with different
        perspectives or approaches, which in turn helps the neurons in our brain
        fire down different pathways. This allows our brain to develop and grow
        with each new pathway explored and reused.

      <h1>How will I use it?</h1>
      <p class="simplebox">
        It's all well and good to talk about something, but implementing what I
        have spoken about to myself is another thing entirely. I personally had
        somewhat of an understanding of neuroplasticity and its effects and use
        them for my own benefit where I can. When I find myself stuck on
        something I usually ask myself “What am I missing”. This to me means “I
        know what I should be doing, but something isn't adding up or working.
        What information or perspectives have I yet to think about that might
        help me solve this problem.”. This is using a “growth mindset”. Trying
        to explore outside my comfort zone, to think about a problem or the
        solution to it in ways I may not usually think. This helps the Neurons
        fire down pathways that may be less used, thus strengthening the pathway
        and how easily accessible it is. To utilize neuroplasticity in my
        learning plan, I need to push myself out of my comfort zone more,
        especially into areas I know I struggle in, Such as designing. I'm not a
        particularly artistic person and struggle to come up with ideas for
        design or layout. I think I will try to engage with design concepts more
        and try to think about how I might go about coming up with ideas and how
        I might design something.
