    <p class="simplebox">
      Neuroplasticity is the science behind our brains, and more so how we think
      and learn. Understanding neuroplasticity can be incredibly helpful for
      anyone either in life. Neuroplasticity is the understanding that our
      brains are ever changing and ever learning. That we don’t necessarily have
      a “cap” on our intelligence or ways of thinking. Our brains have pathways,
      and every time we use a pathway, it strengthens. Everytime we try thinking
      outside of our comfort zone, exploring other avenues for answers or
      results we are wanting can create and help improve other neural pathways.

    <h1 class="container">Growth Mindset</h1>
    <p class="simplebox">
      When you hear someone say “well that's just how I am”, that just simply
      isn't true. They may not have tried to think or explore other avenues and
      in turn are likely restricted themselves. This could be called a “fixed”
      mindset. Exploring Neuroplasticity within ourselves is considered a
      “growth mindset”. It's about changing the way we think and approach
      problems in our lives, whether that be academic or daily life. A “growth
      mindset” can be very helpful to our perspective of ourselves and the
      perspective of how much we can achieve. Instead of thinking about passing
      or failing a new idea or concept, we could change how we think about it,
      such as “I don’t quite understand YET”. This alone changes our perception
      of our task, instead of giving it a rigid structure of success or failure,
      we change it to a fluid structure that has no real end but more of a
      process that allows failure while also encouraging more meaningful
      connections to what is being learned. These connections are what allow us
      to look at problems with different perspectives or approaches, which in
      turn helps the neurons in our brain fire down different pathways. This
      allows our brain to develop and grow with each new pathway explored and
      reused.

    <h1 class="container">How will I use it?</h1>
    <p class="simplebox">
      It's all well and good to talk about something, but implementing what I
      have spoken about to myself is another thing entirely. I personally had
      somewhat of an understanding of neuroplasticity and its effects and use
      them for my own benefit where I can. When I find myself stuck on something
      I usually ask myself “What am i missing”. This to me means “I know what I
      should be doing, but something isn't adding up or working. What
      information or perspectives have I yet to think about that might help me
      solve this problem.”. This is using a “growth mindset”. Trying to explore
      outside my comfort zone, to think about a problem or the solution to it in
      ways I may not usually think. This helps the Neurons fire down pathways
      that may be less used, thus strengthening the pathway and how easily
      accessible it is.To utilize neuroplasticity in my learning plan, I need to
      push myself out of my comfort zone more, especially into areas I know I
      struggle in. Such as designing. I'm not a particularly artistic person and
      struggle to come up with ideas for design or layout. I think I will try to
      engage with design concepts more and try to think about how I might go
      about coming up with ideas and how I might design something.
