      <h3 class="simplebox">How do I work on my Emotional Intelligence?</h3>
      <p class="simplebox">
        Working on your EQ can be a long process. It requires a conscious effort
        of identifying your own emotional state such as allowing you anger to
        rise unchecked. Trying to catch yourself before your emotions take the
        lead. You can't control how others feel, but you can control how you
        react to others. Try to take a moment to understand your own emotions
        and where they are coming from, while also seeing if you emotional
        response is proportionate to the interaction. By catching your emotions
        before you respond you can help smooth the interaction with others
        without it turning into conflict.

      <h5 class="simplebox">Emotional Intelligence tips and tricks</h5>
      <p class="simplebox">
        A good place to start is to slow down how and when you react, take some
        time to think before you allow your emotions to run the conversation.
        Try to clearly communicate yourself and how you feel. This can make you
        feel vulnerable but it helps everyone to know where you stand or how you
        feel. The same goes vice versa, where listening to what others are
        saying without interjection, or if required asking for clarification.
