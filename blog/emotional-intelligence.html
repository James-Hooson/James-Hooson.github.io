      <h2 class="simplebox">What is Emotional Intelligence?</h2>
      <p class="simplebox">
        Emotional Intelligence (EQ) is the ability to understand emotions and
        fellings of yourself and those around you. It stives for a concious
        awareness of how you are felling or how others may feel.

      <h3 class="simplebox">How do I work on my Emotional Intelligence?</h3>
      <p class="simplebox">
        Working on your EQ can be a long process. Those who wish to improve
        their EQ usually start with daily meditations. This is not just sitting
        crosslegged, humming with your eyes closed. Its a state of being, where
        you bring yourself to the present. It helps alleviate us of our usual
        concerns, things from the past or things yet to come. These worries take
        us out of being present, in the now. To start improving your EQ, try and
        give yourself small windows of 5 or 10 minutes, and just listen and feel
        things around you, such as the sound of birds, he breeze on your skin,
        your chest rising and falling with each breath. This is the present.
