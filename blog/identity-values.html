        While working for Victoria University, myself and my Argentinian
        co-worker were eating, when another co-worker came in for some banter.
        However this banter went from simple banter, to racist, when he called
        my co-worker an "Argentinian dog" in a joking manner. This offended me
        as I couldn't understand why he didn't use an insult that didn't have
        racial undertones, or simply swear. I called him out on the spot, asking
        why he had to be racial, when he could use a regular swear or even get
        creative, but instead fell into racism. His actions went against my
        values of treating people with respect, and not using things they cannot
        change such as circumstances of birth. I felt good calling him out, and
        my co-worker thanked me as well as he was uncomfortable. However I think
        I should have spoken further to the racist co-worker to try and explain
        why what he did was wrong.

        My family has a very conservative outlook. So I grew up thinking
        conservatively, voting only for National kind of outlook. They were not
        the best parents to put it politely. This made me question conservatism,
        and meeting my high school girlfriend's parents who were incredibly left
        learning created a catalyst for my own independent thinking, such as
        "what do I value?". I started realizing the conservative outlook was
        very individualist, and was more focused on stepping on top of others to
        get ahead, rather than working together. This to me didn't make sense.
        Why would we want to put others down, or use Race, Religion or Sex to
        determine how qualified someone is. This caused me to spend a long time
        reflecting on what I value, which is more of a collectivist view. Where
        we can all work together to make a better future for all, to treat
        everyone nicely, to help those who look like they need help, and to give
        to others that need it.

        I think growing up with conservative parental techniques, I grew
        resistant to forms of structure, routines and repetition. This can cause
        me to have difficulty in completing tasks, as rigid systems or
        procedures can demotivate me, Or I become bored with the routine and
        repetition. On top of this I struggle with self-promotion and
        networking, struggling to show off or talk about my strengths. I am also
        partial to procrastination and delaying my tasks, causing last minute
        stresses that could have been avoided. These will have to be a conscious
        focus for my work and development at devacademy as well as future jobs.

        My previous job didn't offer opportunities for collaborative work and
        was very individualized. However, now that I have a child, parenting has
        become the work, and although there hasn't been any major resistance or
        tension, there are always small obstacles and decisions to be
        collaboratively made. My Partner and I use a variety of strategies and
        languages to help us navigate parenthood. We use "This makes me Feel"
        rather than blaming someone for the feelings, with an emphasis on using
        kind language. We discuss our options and decide together the best
        course of action with our daughter. We give each other turns to speak to
        have our say when tensions are high. And while we agree on most things,
        we always try to reach a compromise where we both feel comfortable.
