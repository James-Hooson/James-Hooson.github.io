      <h1 class="simplebox">What have I learnt about myself?</h1>
      <p class="simplebox">
        Human Skills learning has helped identify a few things about how I learn
        and how I approach different obstacles in life. To me it was interesting
        using a growth mindset and trying to change how I thought about a
        problem, rather than getting frustrated or helpless when I couldn't
        solve it. When my mind would use phrases like "I don't get this" and
        simply adding "yet" to the end of them has much more of an impact than I
        would have thought. I found using "yet" helped my frustration of not
        understanding and turning it into something that is changeable, that can
        be learned, rather than having something so finite. It encouraged
        understanding and learning instead of something that can't be done. This
        was also confronting to my ego, and how I perceived my own abilities.
        With bootcamp rapidly coming up I feel a bit like an imposter,and not
        confident in my ability to code. However, using the tools learned in
        Human Skill has helped me try to train my mind on how I go about my
        self-perception. Using neuroplasticity to change my immediate thoughts
        about myself to be more positive reinforcement rather than a finite
        negative one. When my mind says "Why are you even here? What am I
        doing?" I try to mentally rephrase it into something like "I'm here to
        learn, and my learning takes its own time."

      <h1 class="simplebox">The role of values in programming</h1>
      <p class="simplebox">
        I find the roles of values, empathy and self-awareness are important in
        programming and learning. With values like integrity, kindness and
        effort being used to hold yourself accountable to a standard that helps
        yourself and others overall. With empathy being empathetic to others
        plights or struggles and trying to help guide or positively affirm how
        well they are doing. With self-awareness being aware of your strengths
        and weaknesses and how to create a learning structure that benefits you
        most. All of this helps a growth mindset, and I'm sure in a work
        environment it helps the overall productivity and inter-employee
        interactions and capability.

      <h1 class="simplebox">Human Skills, Surprises and Challenges</h1>
      <p class="simplebox">
        What surprised me most about Human Skill is just how impactful it is in
        a tech environment. I know my first thought with coding and programming
        was not human skills but more focused on the code itself. However I was
        again surprised to see how relevant human skills are in programming.
        Whether it be oneself and how you go about learning or solving problems,
        how you interact with others on collaborative projects, or even as far
        as how people will interact and feel when it comes to your site or
        product. Human skills also comes with its own challenges, particularly
        with yourself and how confronting it can be when you spend some time
        reflecting on how and why you think like you do about certain problems
        or issues. It takes a lot to admit something to yourself and to
        recognize that active change may be in order to continue your personal
        growth.

      <h1 class="simplebox">Devacademy and Human Skills</h1>
      <p class="simplebox">
        I found it very interesting the focus Devacademy has on Human skills. At
        first my initial reaction was that the focus was more on a work ethic or
        how people interact with one another on collaborative projects. While
        this has truth to it, I personally don't believe it is its focus. I
        think the focus of Human skills in Devacademy has a larger purpose, one
        focused on growth and adaptability. Both I think are crucial to learning
        programming and code. I feel as though without Human skills it would
        hinder a lot of people's ability to learn code and how they go about
        problem solving. To me most code is simply a problem that requires a
        solution. If you want to make a website, where would you start?, How
        would it look?, What sizes do you want things to be?, What font?. These
        are all little problems that require solving with code and having the
        human skills teach us about different ways we can approach these both
        physically and mentally has been monumental to my own learning.
      </p>
      <h1 class="simplebox">Is Human Skills a Waste of Time?</h1>
      <p class="simplebox">
        Some might say Human Skills is a waste of time, Time that could be used
        practicing programming. I couldn't disagree more! I think as previously
        mentioned it has been monumental to my ability to learn programming and
        how I go about solving problems. I believe human skills are part of
        being a programmer. To me programming is mostly about thinking, and if I
        don't change how I go about thinking about a problem, then I would be
        stuck on it forever! Not only is it useful in programming, it's useful
        in the process of learning. Conversations with my peers have shown an
        evolution over the course of the Foundations course from how we talk
        about things to how we express ourselves or how we go about reassuring
        one another. Knowing that its okay to feel as though you aren't doing
        well or retaining the information, and that so long as you keep a growth
        mindset and stay the course, put in the effort to learn, and keep
        telling ourselves 'yet', that our learning is measured by ourselves and
        not others, reinforces the idea that you are more than capable.
