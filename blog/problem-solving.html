      <h1>Problem solving</h1>
      <h1 class="simplebox">A time I was blocked on a simple problem</h1>
      <p class="simplebox">
        The problem I faced is one of my own design. When learning about slice
        and splice for my method research I would go through learning what each
        method did. The problem was that I would try to get through and finish
        my work and in doing so would gingerly skim through some of the
        descriptions. This caused me to not notice that when running the test,
        it gave results that actually didn't align with what I was trying to do. See
        the below my problematic code.
      </p>
      <div class="code-container">
        <pre><code>
  let fruits = ['banana', 'apple', 'orange', 'kiwi', 'grape']

let sliced = fruits.slice(1, 3,)
console.log(sliced) //[ 'apple','orange']
console.log(fruits) //[ 'banana', 'apple', 'orange', 'kiwi', 'grape']
</code></pre>
      </div>
      <p class="simplebox">
        As seen above you can see my original slice that has the parameters of
        taking 1 and 3 and removing them when calling for a slice. When
        returned, I received 2 fruits. I didn't even think twice as I had passed
        the test in that the function worked. Those with a good eye may
        have noticed I asked for 2 changes, and it returned 2, However what I
        didn't notice is the fruits that were returned, were not the fruits in
        the array I wanted. I wanted 1 and 3, which should of been 'apple' and
        'kiwi'. This was thankfully pointed out to me by a colleague so I went
        through and wondered why.
      </p>
      <h1 class="simplebox">How did I solve it?</h1>

      <p class="simplebox">
        The problem here was not that the function wasn’t working so to say, but
        it wasn’t working how I thought or intended it to work. So I went
        through the rubber ducky method, which involves going through and
        talking about each step as though talking to a “rubber duck”. This can
        help you identify mistakes, however for this issue the mistake wasn't
        the problem solving method, as I talked myself through it I found no
        issue. So I went to the next problem solving method, using an LLM to
        explain to me why it isn't working. I was informed that although I did
        indeed ask for 1 & 3 to be sliced, the function does not work that way,
        and in fact works by taking items 1 through 3, but not including 3. So
        while I was getting 2 fruits back, one of those fruits was number 2,
        when my intention was to remove number 3. This made me realise my
        mistake, that I should take my time when reading through material to
        ensure I'm understanding the details.

      <h1>Can I use problem-solving techniques?</h1>

      <h1>Pseudocode</h1>
      <p class="simplebox">
        I feel comfortable using pseudocode, as it is a technique I use in my
        head generally anyway when going through a problem, breaking it down to
        smaller components and what I'm trying to achieve with each step. Trying
        something I am comfortable (and already have some plan) to try
        something, to give it a crack and discover how it should work and
        function. 
      </p>
      <h1>Rubber ducky method</h1>

      <p class="simplebox">
         As in the example above I feel comfortable talking myself
        through the problem to see if I catch something out.
      </p>

        <h1>Reading error messages</h1> 
       <p class="simplebox">
       I feel pretty comfortable although I do need to improve my
        syntax and what each word entails. With my own experience of reading
        error messages largely stemming from video games and overloading them
        with mods.
      </p>

        <h1>Console.logging</h1> 
        <p class="simplebox">
         I think I could do some more practice with
        console.log, but I feel pretty comfortable using it.
      </p>

          <h1>Googling</h1>

          <p class="simplebox">
            A timeless classic, when in doubt, google! But always checking how I google, where
        the information is coming from and is it applicable to my situation.
      </p> 

        <h1>Asking your peers for help</h1>

        <p class="simplebox"> 
          I have already asked for help from my peers,
        and with our homegroup we have organized in previous weeks a weekly
        meetup to discuss our confusions or problems we are experiencing, and to
        get guidance from our peers.
      </p>

        <h1>Asking coaches for help</h1>

         <p class="simplebox"> 
          I have yet to really utilize this, but I do feel comfortable that if a problem would
        occur that any of the previous methods could not solve or assist in, I
        would happily go to a coach for assistance.
      </p>

        <h1>Improving your process with reflection</h1> 

         <p class="simplebox">
          I do mentally reflect on how I made a mistake and what I
        could do to ensure I cover my bases to improve in the future.
