      <h2 class="simplebox">What is your long term goal or career pathway?</h2>
      <p class="simplebox">
        My long term goal would ideally be to land a remote job in web
        development to allow me to spend more time with my daughter and to also
        get an income to start looking to buy a house. Long term I would love to
        have a home with a large backyard to have chickens and ducks!

        A description of your strengths and limitations when it comes to
        learning
      </h3>
      <p class="simplebox">
        I have great problem solving skills and can follow instructions very
        easily, however I have noticed I get easily disuaded or demoralized when
        I see others work being significantly better than my own when we are
        learning the same stuff. However I am telling myself that some people
        may just be design minded, which is a limitation of myself as I don't
        think I am very creative or design savvy.

        What skills (non-technical/human skills) would you like to see developed
        in yourself while at Dev Academy?
      </h4>
      <p class="simplebox">
        I would like to feel more confident in what I do, especially around
        coding. I have found the handbook materials easy to follow when given
        instructions, but find it hard to plan something out for me without
        instruction. Not that I need a word for word on the code, but more what
        the overall design is going to look like.

      <h5 class="simplebox">
        A commitment to how you will manage your workload in this programme.
      </h5>

      <p class="simplebox">
        I have managed to work productively by managing my time with Toggl,
        ensuring I do a set amount of work before a quick break. Sometimes those
        breaks may be earlier if I find things building up for myself, so that I
        may sit and think about it, while also getting some fresh air and a
        change of environment. I have already asked for help a couple of times.
        I try not to spend too long working it out for myself, but I will try
        every avenue I can to solve a problem myself before asking for help.

        A description of what you expect from the Facilitation team
      </h6>

      <p class="simplebox">
        My expectation from the facilitators is to give constructive feedback
        where necessary, help in a timely fashion, and guidance where they think
        it is needed.
      </p>

      <h6 class="simplebox">
        Any scheduling information such as block-out times when you are
        committed to other things.
      </h6>

      <p class="simplebox">
        I have already started to try and schedule my life, but with a 5 month
        old daughter things can go off script very quickly. Currently I know
        every wednesday we have a playgroup from 12-3pm, which I usually go with
        my partner and Daughter. I do have the option to stay back if I feel I
        need to get in more work time. I also do grocery shopping on thursdays
        which I can't get away from, but with good time mangement and adding
        time onto others days that has been taken away on thursday should ensure
        I will have enough time to get all the neccessary work done.
