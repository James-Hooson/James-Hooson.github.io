    <h2>What is your long term goal or career pathway?</h2>
    <p class="simplebox3">
      My long term goal would ideally be to land a remote job in web
      developmentto allow me to spend more time with my daughter and to also get
      an income to start looking to buy a house. Long term I would love to have
      a home with a large backyard to have chickens and ducks!

    <h3>
      A description of your strengths and limitations when it comes to learning
    </h3>
    <p class="simplebox3">
      I have great problem solving skills and can follow instructions very
      easily, however I have noticed I get easily disuaded or demoralized when I
      see others work being significantly better than my own when we are
      learning the same stuff. However I am telling myself that some people may
      just be design minded, which is a limitation of myself as I don't think I
      am very creative or design savvy.

    <h4>
      What skills (non-technical/human skills) would you like to see developed
      in yourself while at Dev Academy?
    </h4>
    <p class="simplebox3">
      I would like to feel more confident in what I do, especially around
      coding. I have found the handbook materials easy to follow when given
      instructions, but find it hard to plan something out for me without
      instruction. Not that I need a word for word on the code, but more what
      the overall design is going to look like.

      A commitment to how you will manage your workload in this programme.

    <p class="simplebox3">
      I have managed to work productively by managing my time with Toggl,
      ensuring I do a set amount of work before a quick break. Sometimes those
      breaks may be earlier if I find things building up for myself, so that I
      may sit and think about it, while also getting some fresh air and a change
      of environment. I have already asked for help a couple of times, I try not
      to spend too long working it out for myself, but I will try every avenue I
      can to solve a problem myself before asking for help.

    <h6>A description of what you expect from the Facilitation team</h6>
    >

    <p class="simplebox3">
      My expectation from the facilitators is to give constructive feedback
      where necessary, help in a timely fashion, and guidance where they think
      it is needed.
    </p>

    <h7
      >Any scheduling information such as block-out times when you are committed
      to other things.</h7

    <p class="simplebox3">
      I have already started to try and schedule my life, but with a 5 month old
      daughter things can go off script very quickly. Currently I know every
      wednesday we have a playgroup from 12-3pm, which I usually go with my
      partner and Daughter. I do have the option to stay back if I feel I need
      to get in more work time. I also do grocery shopping on thursdays which I
      cant get away from, but with good time mangement and adding time onto
      others days that has been taken away on thursday should ensure I will have
      enough time to get all the neccessary work done.
