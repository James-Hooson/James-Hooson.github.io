      <p class="simplebox">
        My long term goal is likely very similar to my foundations learning
        plan, an obvious one is to complete this Devacademy course, but
        ultimately my goal is a remote work situation so I can still have time
        with my family.

        What do you think your biggest strengths and limitations will be in
        Bootcamp?
      </h1>
      <p class="simplebox">
        I think my biggest strengths will be my eagerness to learn, with my
        limitations being my confidence in my abilities.

      <h1 class="simplebox">
        What do you think your biggest non-technical challenge at Bootcamp will
        be?
      </h1>
      <p class="simplebox">
        Similar to my limitations, I think the feeling of being an imposter
        where I still dont feel confident in my abilities.

        What non-technical skills would you like to see developed in yourself

        I would like to improve my confidence overall with my ability to write
        code

      <h1 class="simplebox">
        What are your expectations of yourself on Bootcamp?
      </h1>
      <p class="simplebox">
        My expectations are similar to that of foundations such as the
        accessability of facilitators for help when required. But also there is
        expectation on my peers when working collaboratively to be present and
        timely.

      <p class="simplebox">
        My long term goal would ideally be to land a remote job in web
        development to allow me to spend more time with my daughter and to also
        get an income to start looking to buy a house. Long term I would love to
        have a home with a large backyard to have chickens and ducks!

        A description of your strengths and limitations when it comes to
        learning
      </h3>
      <p class="simplebox">
        I have great problem solving skills and can follow instructions very
        easily, however I have noticed I get easily disuaded or demoralized when
        I see others work being significantly better than my own when we are
        learning the same stuff. However I am telling myself that some people
        may just be design minded, which is a limitation of myself as I don't
        think I am very creative or design savvy.

      <h4 class="simplebox">
        What skills (non-technical/human skills) would you like to see developed
        in yourself while at Dev Academy?
      </h4>
      <p class="simplebox">
        I would like to feel more confident in what I do, especially around
        coding. I have found the handbook materials easy to follow when given
        instructions, but find it hard to plan something out for me without
        instruction. Not that I need a word for word on the code, but more what
        the overall design is going to look like.
      </p>

      <h5 class="simplebox">
        A commitment to how you will manage your workload in this programme.
      </h5>

      <p class="simplebox">
        I have managed to work productively by managing my time with Toggl,
        ensuring I do a set amount of work before a quick break. Sometimes those
        breaks may be earlier if I find things building up for myself, so that I
        may sit and think about it, while also getting some fresh air and a
        change of environment. I have already asked for help a couple of times.
        I try not to spend too long working it out for myself, but I will try
        every avenue I can to solve a problem myself before asking for help.
      </p>

      <h6 class="simplebox">
        A description of what you expect from the Facilitation team
      </h6>

      <p class="simplebox">
        My expectation from the facilitators is to give constructive feedback
        where necessary, help in a timely fashion, and guidance where they think
        it is needed.
      </p>

      <h6 class="simplebox">
        Any scheduling information such as block-out times when you are
        committed to other things.
      </h6>

      <p class="simplebox">
        I have already started to try and schedule my life, but with a 5 month
        old daughter things can go off script very quickly. Currently I know
        every wednesday we have a playgroup from 12-3pm, which I usually go with
        my partner and Daughter. I do have the option to stay back if I feel I
        need to get in more work time. I also do grocery shopping on thursdays
        which I can't get away from, but with good time mangement and adding
        time onto others days that has been taken away on thursday should ensure
        I will have enough time to get all the neccessary work done.
